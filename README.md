# Simulation-Program-for-Round-Robin-Scheduling-Algorithm
A Simulation Program for Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm is a software 
tool that simulates the behavior of a Round Robin scheduling algorithm in a computer system. 
The program generates a set of processes with random arrival times and CPU burst times and runs the Round Robin algorithm for a set amount of time, 
typically specified in time units.
